      CrossFit is a training program that builds strength and conditioning through extremely varied and challenging workouts.
      In other words, it will help you <strong>burn fat and tone your muscles</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      CrossFit takes all aspects of fitness and sports, cherry-picks the best and most effective,
      and <strong>crafts them together into exciting workouts</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      CrossFit consists of functional movements as they are so beneficial for all ages.
      <strong> Functional movements </strong> are those that mimic actions you perform in your day-to-day life:
      carry groceries, pick up a baby or chair off the ground, climb stairs, get out of bed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, <strong>CrossFit workouts are so effective</strong> because of their emphasis on the elements of load, distance and speed,
      which help athletes develop high levels of power. The workouts utilize different equipment to accomplish this,
      including dumbbells, kettle bells, rowers and air bikes, medicine balls, jump ropes, rings and plyo boxes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each day the workout will test a different part of your strength or conditioning, not specializing in one particular skill,
      but rather with the goal of <strong>building an athletic body thatâ€™s capable of practically anything and everything</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The 45-min classes consist of a small group of athletes with one or two trainers, who teach safe movement patterns,
      explain the workout of the day, and modify the workout based on each individual athlete's abilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>You don't have to be in shape</strong> to start CrossFit.
      All you need is the desire to improve yourself, and our trainers will be there to guide you to your goals.
