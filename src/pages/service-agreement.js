      <h3>Service Agreement</h3>

      <p>
        This document constitutes the Agreement between Strength & Conditioning Outlet, LLC, hereafter “CrossFit Secaucus”, and __(Client's Full Name)__, hereafter “Client”.
      </p>

      <p>
        Client hereby agrees to purchase an automatically renewing pricing option starting on ______ (date).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Credit Card Authorization / EFT Request and Authorization: </strong>
        Client hereby authorizes CrossFit Secaucus or its assigns to make periodic charges or withdrawals (“EFT Authorization”) from the account designated to pay the initial payment or the account on file for the Client or replacement account designated by Client and accepted by CrossFit Secaucus for payment of any and all fees, late charges, costs, expenses, or any other monies due to CrossFit Secaucus under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.<br/>
        The monthly pricing option fee will be charged in advance of service periodically to the payment method designated above. A 3% convenience fee applies to all credit/debit card transactions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>No Refunds: </strong>
        All sales are final, and no refunds are given. Refunds are not given for unused class reservation credits, including but not limited to periods of business closure due to government mandates, weather conditions or holidays.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Pricing Option: </strong>
        A pricing option costs $180 and it includes 12 Class Reservation Credits per Term. A Term is four (4) consecutive weeks. Class Reservation Credits expire four (4) weeks after the date of purchase or the date of renewal of the pricing option. Pricing options are non-transferable.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Price Change: </strong>
        CrossFit Secaucus reserves the right to increase the cost for a pricing option with a 28-day notice (“Notice”) that includes the new price as well as the date that the new price will take effect. The next renewal 28 days after the Notice was given as well as all other future renewals will automatically be billed at the new price. No action from the Client is required.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Automatic Renewals: </strong>
        The pricing option will automatically renew either: (1) at the end of the Term, or (2) when all class credits are used, whichever occurs first.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Renewal Cancellation: </strong>
        Automatic renewal cancelations require a 28-day notice. Cancellations are not retroactive. No exceptions. Relocation for employment, personal, health, or for any other reason still requires a 28-day notice. Cancellation requests must be emailed to trainers@crossfit-secaucus.com. No other form of transmittal, whether written or oral, will be permitted or honored. A confirmation email from a CrossFit Secaucus staff member is required for the cancellation to take effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Hold: </strong>
        Automatic renewals can be temporarily suspended (“Hold”) for a minimum of four (4) weeks to a maximum of twelve (12) weeks (“Hold Period”). Holds may only be prospective from the date of the transmittal of the confirmation Hold email. No retroactive holds are permitted. No exceptions. When a pricing option is on Hold, Class Reservation Credits cannot be used. The Term is extended by the duration of the requested Hold Period. Additionally, Client agrees to renew for at least one (1) Term at the end of the Hold Period.<br/>
        A request for a Hold must be submitted 14 days prior to the start of the desired Hold Period and must be emailed to trainers@crossfit-secaucus.com. No other form of transmittal, whether written or oral, will be permitted or honored. A confirmation email from a CrossFit Secaucus staff member is required for the Hold to take effect.<br/>
        Despite the 14-day requirement described in the preceding paragraph, a signed Doctor’s Note that states the timespan for which the Client cannot physically participate in a CrossFit Secaucus class may be submitted for an immediate Hold.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Doctor’s Note: </strong>
         A note on the letterhead of a board certified medical doctor regarding the Client’s inability to physically participate in any Crossfit Secaucus activities.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Class Reservation: </strong>
        Client is required to make a reservation for a class at least 30 minutes in advance of a classes’ scheduled start time via the scheduling system to be allowed to attend class. CrossFit Secaucus does not guarantee space in a class. Attendance in a class may be restricted to Client based on government restrictions, pricing option, type of class, size of class or for any other reason in CrossFit Secaucus’s sole discretion.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Class Reservation Credits: </strong>
        Client uses Class Reservation Credits to reserve space in a scheduled class. Unused Class Reservation Credits expire at the end of the Term. No exceptions. Therefore, unused Class Reservation Credits do not roll over or carry over into a subsequent Term.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Class Reservation Cancelation: </strong>
        A Class Reservation may be canceled eight (8) hours in advance of a class scheduled before noon, and four (4) hours in advance of a class scheduled at or after noon. Failure to timely cancel a Class Reservation will yield the loss of the Class Reservation credit as the Class Reservation Credit will be considered used. No exceptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Account Balance: </strong>
        Payments for product purchases (i.e. apparel, drinks, supplements) may be deferred by putting the charges on to an account tab. Client’s full account tab balance consisting of all purchases will be collectively charged to the designated payment method at the end of the calendar month.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Late Payment / Declined Credit Card Fees: </strong>
        A $20 fee will be charged on any payment made past the due date or declined for insufficient funds.  Meaning if Client is scheduled to be billed for a renewal Term and payment is not made in full at that time, then an additional $20 will be assessed, and owed in addition to the full Term payment.
