        <strong>Cancellation</strong>:
        Pricing option renewals must be cancelled 30 days prior to the next renewal date, and cancellations are not retroactive. No exceptions.

      <p>
        <strong>Hold</strong>:
        Pricing option renewals can be put on hold for one (1) to three (3) calendar months. No retroactive or partial month holds are permitted. No exceptions. The pricing option automatically renews at the end of the hold period. The first pricing option renewal immediately following the hold period cannot be modified or cancelled.
